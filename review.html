          <p class="review-text">Beautiful visuals. Amazing music. Interesting characters design. The Gacha system in a problem that makes the exploration poor. You have little to no reward by exploring the world. You don't find chests full of amazing and rare intems. Instead, you gotta use the Gacha system to get any good item. The narrative is VERY boring for me. The story behing ALL the loads and loads of unending texts might be good. The rest is just there to waste your time and make you fall asleep of boredom while playing.</p>

          <p class="review-text">Genshin Impact is a whimsical, wondrous land dripping with unbridled charm and appeal, combining a ridiculously compelling reward loop with unfettered, continuous discovery. In this world I felt like a child visiting theme park for the first time — dazzled, mesmerized, and completely swept away. I only wish the shimmering glow wasn’t marred by a ghoulish monetization model, but that’s something I’m willing to overlook for my ticket to this fascinating realm.</p>

          <p class="review-text">The character design at beginning is good. The gameplay is tedious; the story is crazy (and they dont give you a freaking skip button lol); terrible gacha experience. These issues could be fixed if Dawei pay more efforts in later update. However, what we get is their arrogance and silence, and even the character design is nolonger appealing to their players. If you are seeking for a gacha game, wuthering wave and snowbreak will be a better option for you instead of choosing Genshin.</p>

          <p class="review-text">Overall it is good enough, the artstyle, animations, combat, and story are nice, but there's one thing that decreases the score: Story pacing and Gacha.Even though I like the story, it is simply too slow, you have to stand there, watching the characters speak for literal hours just to complete a single quest, I feel it is more "standing there clicking to skip dialogue" than doing the quest itself. And the Gacha, of course... I personally feel spending money isn't that necessary, but even with that, spinning to unlock characters is something that I've never liked, it is in my opinion, managed better than in other games.</p>

          <p class="review-text">Free or not, that means nothing to me I don't rate games based on how much they cost anyway. This is an annoying game because it could have been great but the story just does nothing to help to pull you along and the combat is very shallow. Also the basic game loop of exploring and leveling is ok but gets repetitive very quickly. Is a shame because if they just added some depth to the combat and made the missions scale to you level instead of insisting on massive leaps in level between missions it would be a good game. But the other main problem is there is way to little of the scripted story missions and the game just expects you to explore and grind. That would be fine if the world was engaging but like I said it gets boring quickly.</p>

          <p class="review-text">Despite its often less-than-subtle nods to Nintendo's Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact does enough differently to stand apart. Throw in punchier combat, a more traditional story packed with interesting characters, and an outstanding score and Genshin Impact easily sits among the upper echelon of games released this year. Hopefully miHoYo relaxes the stamina system and gacha rates soon, because Teyvat is a world absolutely worth revisting. They're just making it difficult for anyone but gacha fans to find the motivation to hold on..</p>

          <p class="review-text">Regardless of constant and tedious grinding, less than satisfactory rewards from time to time, and unutilized potential for a greater gaming experience, Genshin Impact is undoubtedly an amazing RPG offering a vast array of things to do in game. The combat is simple yet fun, and the world is massive and diverse. Throughout my countless days of playing the game, I have never found the exploration dull. There are many small things about the game that I enjoy,</p>
